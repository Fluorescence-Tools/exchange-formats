Setup:
    Setup name: IBH TCSPC
    Description: >
        The measurements were performed on an IBH 5000 (IBH, Scotland) eTCSPC using a PQ PDL (LDH-P-C470)
        for excitation at 10 MHz. IRF was recorded detecting the light scattered by a ludox suspension at
        the wavelength of the laser. The laser was attenuated using a OD filter to an intensity comparable
        to the intensity of the sample. The excitation and emission slits were set to 2 nm and 16 nm,
        respectively.
