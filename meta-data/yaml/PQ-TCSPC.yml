        Description: > 
         The measurements were performed on a Fluotime200 (Picoquant) using a SuperK extreme whitelight laser (NKT photonics)
         operated at 20 MHz and 485 nm. 
         IRF was recorded detecting the light scattered by a ludox suspension at the wavelength of the laser. 
         The laser was attenuated using a OD filter to an intensity comparable to the intensity of the sample.
         The excitation and emission slits were set to 2 nm and 5 nm, respectively.
